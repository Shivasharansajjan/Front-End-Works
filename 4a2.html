       <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">It is a part of the Java programming language that one can use for developing or creating a general-purpose app. Its main focus is to build such general applications. The J2SE (Java Standard Edition) is known as Core Java. It mainly covers concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Its main pillars are inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. These are:

        Inheritance – It allows one to make use of the already existing class without even writing the code from the very beginning. It thus ensures code reusability in a better way.
        Polymorphism – It allows the writing of code in a certain way to make the object behave in multiple ways.
        Encapsulation – It combines methods and data into a single unit.
        Abstraction – It allows the writing of a code in a way that hides the details of implementation. It, in turn, reduces the complexity. Allows writing the code in a way that hides the implementation details to reduce complexity.
        As an addition, Core Java also covers concepts like AWT, threading, swing, and collections. AWT and swing help in building powerful GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). Threading, furthermore, assists in the simultaneous execution of multiple processes and the collections allow a user to manipulate a group of objects. All-in-all, Core Java covers all the basic and fundamental Java programming language concepts.</p> 
        <p style="color: rgb(249, 255, 255);">Core Java covers some topics like data types, OOP, operators, exception handling, swing, threading, and collections.
            Core Java assists a user in building some general-purpose applications. These applications are generally independent of any platform. Examples include various event planning applications, graphic video games such as snakes, and calculators.Java Editions
            To have a clear understanding of the core Java, it is important that you know about the different defined editions supported by Java. Here are some of those key Java editions:
            
            1. Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
            Java SE serves as a computing platform used to develop desktop or window-based applications. Core Java refers to the fundamental part of Java SE, where developers create desktop applications using basic Java concepts. JDK (Java Development Kit) is a well-known implementation of Java SE.
            
            2. Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
            Also referred to as Java 2 Platform or Java Enterprise Edition OR J2EE, this edition is focused on enterprise development, enabling developers to build applications for servers. Java EE is commonly used for web development.
            
            3. Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
            Java ME is the micro edition intended for developing mobile phone applications. It is specifically tailored for mobile application development. It also helps to execute Java-based applications on mobile devices having restricted memory and processing power.
            
            Based on the above learning, it is now clear that Core Java is an integral part of Java SE, which is the main foundation for all other Java Editions.
            
            Concepts in Core Java
            Here, we will discuss some key Core Java concepts
            
            1. Java Fundamentals
            It represents the main variant of Core Java, typically used for developing regular desktop applications. It encompasses a subset of Java SE technology, incorporating both general-purpose and specific-purpose APIs, combining essential Java capabilities with a comprehensive understanding of the language.
            
            2. OOPs Concepts
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the programming paradigm that is basically based on the concepts of objects that include data and behaviour. We all know Java is an object-oriented language, and here are some of the key OOP concepts which are included in the Core Java syllabus
            
            Class: These are the templates that determine the structure and action of the objects. It encompasses data and functions which exist on that data.
            Object: They are basically examples of class- a real demonstration of the structure.
            Encapsulation: It refers to the gathering of data and the method which functions and works on the data included in a class.
            Inheritance: It helps the class to inherit properties and behaviour from different classes, which we also called as a superclass.
            Polymorphism: This allows objects of diverse types of classes to be regarded as the object of the superclass.</p>
