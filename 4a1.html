   <p style="color: azure;">Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is a highly popular, object-oriented programming language. This platform independent programming language is utilized for Android development, web development, artificial intelligence, cloud applications, and much more.

    In this tutorial, we will cover everything from the basics of Java syntax to advanced topics like object-oriented programming and exception handling. So, by the end of this tutorial, you will have a strong understanding of Java and be ready to start writing your own Java applications. So letâ€™s get started on this comprehensive Free Java programming course!</p> 
    <p style="color: azure;">Java provides a class with name Class in java.lang package. Instances of the class Class represent classes and interfaces in a running Java application. The primitive Java types (boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double), and the keyword void are also represented as Class objects. It has no public constructor. Class objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). It is a final class, so we cannot extend it. The Class class methods are widely used in Reflection API.

        In Java, the java.lang.Class class is a built-in class that represents a class or interface at runtime. It contains various methods that provide information about the class or interface, such as its name, superclass, interfaces, fields, and methods.

        Here are some commonly used methods of the Class class:
        getName(): Returns the name of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
        getSimpleName(): Returns the simple name of the class or interface represented by this Class object.
        getSuperclass(): Returns the superclass of the class represented by this Class object.
        getInterfaces(): Returns an array of interfaces implemented by the class or interface represented by this Class object.
        getField(String name): Returns a Field object that represents the public field with the specified name in the class or interface represented by this Class object.</p>
